Hello! My name is Jinghan Yang. I am currently a final-year undergraduate student at [the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk), under the mentorship of [Zhonghua Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/drliu/home). 
My academic interests lie in interpretable machine learning and large language models. 
My research journey took off under the guidance of [Byron Wallace](https://www.byronwallace.com) during my exchange at [Northeastern University (NEU)](https://www.northeastern.edu).
I am taking a gap year at [Microsoft Research Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) advised by [Shuming Ma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shumma/).
